Hi
Previously, I have used Selenium in C# and Java for my automation work, but over the months I have been hearing more about Cypress as a test automation tool.
The process for this role made me look more into it and I have presented my automation tests in a Cypress js format.
I was also strict with the timeframes given in the task document.
Cheers
Chaz
